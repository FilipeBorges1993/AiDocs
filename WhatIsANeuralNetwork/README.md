# Neural Networks

## Overview

Neural networks are a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and function, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a series of algorithms that aim to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics how the human brain operates. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers:

1. **Input Layer**: Receives initial data
2. **Hidden Layer(s)**: Processes the data
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final result

Neural networks can learn and improve their performance over time by adjusting the strength of connections between neurons based on the data they process.

## Key Concepts

- **Neurons**: Basic units that receive input, process it, and produce output
- **Weights**: Values that determine the strength of connections between neurons
- **Activation Functions**: Functions that determine the output of a neuron
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm used for training neural networks

## Applications

Neural networks are used in various fields, including:

- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Financial forecasting
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles
